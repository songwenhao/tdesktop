# check fix of regression of commit ce8071b9d3312b3599714fc36fcc3fac11cdae97:
# Return value of string.find() was ignored in AffixMgr::cpdrep_check(),
# applying REP replacements at all positions before the last matching position.
#
# For example a regression in Hungarian spell checking:
#
# Correct closed compound word "fa+ajtó" was rejected: the ó -> o replacement
# applied on the second character position, replacing "aa" with "o" there
# (2-character length of UTF-8 character "ó"), and the result "fojtó"
# is a correct dictionary word, which was the reason for rejection.
